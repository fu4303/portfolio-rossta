*This post is part of a series on building Connect Four with SVG, Vue.js,
Elixir, and the Phoenix framework.*

Lately, I've gotten excited about [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for JavaScript
view rendering due to its versatility, low barrier to entry, and community
supported extensions for state management and routing. As a way to learn Vue, I
decided to use it to help build out the frontend for my Connect Four game.
