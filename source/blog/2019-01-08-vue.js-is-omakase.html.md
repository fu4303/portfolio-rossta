It's been six years (yikes, time flies!) since David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator the Ruby on Rails framework, wrote this about [Rails](https://dhh.dk//2012/rails-is-omakase.html) and what that means for both users of and contributors to the framework. I believe Vue.js is omakase as well and this is part of what makes it a great choice as a frontend JavaScript framework.

> There are lots of à la carte software environments in this world... I want this for my ORM, I want that for my template language, and let's finish it off with this routing library... It's a very popular way of consuming software. Rails is not that. Rails is omakase. A team of chefs picked out the ingredients, designed the APIs, and arranged the order of consumption on your behalf according to their idea of what would make for a tasty full-stack framework. The menu can be both personal and quirky. It isn't designed to appeal to the taste of everyone, everywhere. - DHH

I love this metaphor, because a) Rails, including all its API choices and baggage, has treated me very well throughout my career in tech, and b) I love to dine omakase.

What does this have to do with Vue? Loosely, I could say Rails and Vue are both frameworks for web development, but they solve different problems. They're not mutually exclusive either; in fact, Vue is gaining momentum as a frontend choice in Rails apps, e.g. GitLab, LearnZillion, as it has been more notably for teams using Laravel or Node.js. I believe Vue's growing popularity is, in part, like Rails, that its menu is extremely well-curated and that its recommended ingredients, perhaps not to everyone's taste, are well-suited for many, if not the majority.

## Enjoy a multiple-course meal

One thing Vue does, within its domain, is provide most of, if not all, the courses of the full meal of a frontend framework. These days, developers have come to expect an approachable API to build components and a fast implementation built on top of a virtual dom. Vue provides sensible defaults in its Webpack configuration.

* Drawing a hard line on API design on what goes in, what goes out
- with the new Vue CLI: Webpack config setup for hot module replacement, code-splitting, tree-shaking, efficient long term caching

- pre-configured opt-ins for TypeScript, Progressive Web Apps, ESlint, multiple test runners
* Sensible defaults:
- Vue Router,
- Vuex,
- Vue test utils

## Substitutions cost little extra

Some teams prefer to cobble together projects from individual dishes and ingredients. I’d argue that the right framework will suit most of us most of the time right out of the box.

For Vue developers, framework and its ecosystem provides adequate if not excellent implementations of many dependencies that are important, but tangential, to the task of building delightful user interfaces.

As an example, while I think Webpack is an amazing piece of software, I don’t want to take the time to maintain a custom configuration for transpiling single file components or enable predictable long term caching from project to project when we have deadlines to meet. The Vue CLI defaults are just fine. Still need to customize? Vue provides an API to extend the base configuration while making it easier to upgrade to take advantage of framework-supported improvements.

## Props to an opinionated chef

And you may not agree with everything on the menu. That's fine! Many of the defaults can be easily changed through configuration or add-ons. Don't like mustache-style templates? Change it `Vue.config.template = FIXME`. Maybe you can't stand the fact that Vue has templates at all; coming from React and JSX, *I just want to use JavaScript* is the party line. Well, that's ok too, you can write Vue components with JSX inside of render functions after adding another [Babel plugin](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx).

Much has been made of Vue's choice to avoid class syntax for components as the default. [Link]. It seems to work for React, therefore, it has to be in Vue or we won't use it. So be it. But there are excellent reasons for this decision, one of which is for Vue to work without a build environment; as a feature, this makes Vue incredibly easy to get up-and-running, for beginners learning the framework or for seasoned developers trying out a quick prototype. "It will fail" some said. I suppose that remains to be seen, but after several years of arguing, the framework continues to thrive.

## Expect a consistent experience for all customers

This point is especially important for beginners. There are plenty of tangential decisions that we can safely leave up to the maintainers - for folks learning the framework or even web development altogether for the first time. It takes months and years to build up a deeper appreciation of the thought that has gone into these decisions.

> once the usage of the API is down pat, anyone and everyone who knows Vue is basically doing the same thing. This also means the need for best practices are held to a minimum and both of these advantages mean cognitive load over time is reduced. i.e. when you dig into someone else’s component, you understand it quickly. This all in turn means Vue code is more robust and in the end, it’s of higher quality. - Scott Molinari

When my late wife and I lived in New York City, our favorite restaurant was [Zenkichi](https://www.zenkichi.com/
). The cuisine is Japanese brasserie, but the experience is so much more. The primary menu option is the chef's omakase.

It's housed in a small building with a wooden exterior and no discernable markings. Located near the East River in the Williamsburg of Brooklyn, it's easy to miss from the outside.

The interior is dark, romantic, hand-crafted. Each table upstairs is like a small private dining room with a pull-down curtain and a small buzzer to summon the wait staff.

Though patrons may choose to order à la carte, we always ate omakase, where the chef chooses all the courses for us. Of course, some courses weren't to our liking—but we trusted the thought and expertise that had gone into the decision-making. We loved the experience every single time.

The chef’s menu need not be reserved for special occasions in web development.
